# RUN GET

[Invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=731961127239680051&scope=bot) the bot to your Discord server.

## What It Does

It sends information on recently verified speedruns for any game (on speedrun.com) that you pick.

## Set Up

Once RUN GET is in your server, you need to assign it a channel to send messages to, and tell it one or more games to watch. Simply send a message mentioning RUN GET, mention the channel you want RUN GET to post in, and any number of games you want it to watch.

In order to identify a game, send the game abbreviation from speedrun.com. For instance, if you want RUN GET to watch for new The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past runs, and you know the leaderboard is `https://www.speedrun.com/alttp`, then you'd use `alttp`.

You must only mention one channel in your message. However, you can include more than one game. If you want to remove a game, add a `!` before the game abbreviation, like `!alttp`.
